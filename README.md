# ios-Quiz

Application with two arrays: questions and answers. These two arrays are dependent on each other as well as the 
'Show Question' and 'Show Answer' buttons that are used to update the values in the label fields.

Learned to create an iOS application witha single view using a storyboard. Attached properties and methods to the labels and buttons.
